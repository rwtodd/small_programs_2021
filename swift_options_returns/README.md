# option-returns

A program that covers the same kind of roi-estimation utilities I already
had implemented as a powershell module.  Since I don't use pwsh on the mac, I
thought I would use the opportunity to learn some Swift programming.

For this, I used Apple's command-line parsing library, which was a joy to use.
