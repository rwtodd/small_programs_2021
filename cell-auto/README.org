* Fun with Cellular Automata

  I thought it would be fun to have a playground for cellular
  automata... look in the cellz.clj file for examples.  It is set up
  for rewrite rules which look at the 2 cells above (=run-rule-w2=)
  and rules that take the 3 cells above (=run-rule-w3=).  The
  function are not limited to binary values.  Anything from 0 to 255
  is ok.

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(run-rule-w3 30 (initial-random-cells 21 3) rfunc-3)
  #+END_SRC
